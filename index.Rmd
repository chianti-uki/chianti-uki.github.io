###Welcome to my homepage

*Hello! My name is Xiangyu Shi (I often go by **Chianti**), a first-year master student in biotatistics at Mailman School of Public Health, Columbia University.* 



*I define myself as a wanderlust traveler. I am originally from Tsingtao, China, then I went to high school in Calabasas, Southern California. In 2012, I moved to New Jersey and attended college at Rutgers University with a major in Biochemial toxicology and a minor in Mathmatics. I moved back to the west coast right after I finished college, and worked as a lab assistant at a clinical lab in Irvine, Southern California. And here I am now, in New York City, pursuing a higher degree in the STEM field!*
